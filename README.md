 # ✈️ Flight Data Analysis with Pandas

This project explores flight data using real-world datasets containing information about flights, airlines, and airports. Using **Pandas**, I perform data cleaning, transformation, and analysis to answer insightful business and operational questions.

## 📁 Datasets Used

- `flights.csv` — Flight-level data (schedules, delays, cancellations, etc.)
- `airlines.csv` — Airline codes and names
- `airports.csv` — Airport locations and codes

- 🏙️ Airports data: [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays?select=airports.csv)
 


## 🧹 Data Cleaning

- Removed leading/trailing whitespace from columns
- Ensured column types are consistent (e.g., integers for delay times)
